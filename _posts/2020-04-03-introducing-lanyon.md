Medieval Networks of Memory is a digital project, hosted by [Stanford Text Technologies](https://texttechnologies.stanford.edu/). It aims to reveal a new and dynamic picture of thirteenth-century religious and social networks and community commemoration. It will achieve this through describing, mapping, visualizing and analysing unique and culturally rich textual artefacts—the Mortuary Roll of Lucy of Hedingham, now kept at the British Library, and the Mortuary Roll of Amphelisa of Lillechurch, which belongs to St John’s College, Cambridge.

Our research visualizes which English institutions of men and women were united in their effort to remember Prioress Lucy de Vere and how they sought to inscribe their respects to her. The Roll reveals a great deal about the varieties of religious houses in around 1225; the nature of scribal practices; how forms of communication functioned; and the esteem in which nuns like Lucy and Amphelisa were held.
