Medieval Networks of Memory is a digital project, hosted by Stanford Text Technologies and Stanford Manuscript Sciences. It aims to reveal a new and dynamic picture of thirteenth-century religious and social networks and community commemoration. It transcribes, describes, maps, visualizes, and analyses two unique and culturally rich textual artefacts: the Mortuary Roll of Lucy of Hedingham, now London, British Library, Egerton MS 2849; and the Mortuary Roll of Amphelisa of Lillechurch, now Camrbidge, St Johnâ€™s College, MS N. 31. We are immensely grateful to the British Library for digitizing the Egerton Roll, and to Kathryn McKee, Special Collections Curator at St John's College. 

Our research visualizes the journey of the Breviators, who visited British religious institutions of men and women to unite them in their condolences on the losses of Prioresses Lucy de Vere of Castle Hedingham and Amphelisa of Lillechurch. The Rolls reveal considerable information about the varieties of religious houses in the first quarter of the thirteenth century, as well as a detailed and fascinating picture of scribal practices in this critical period. From the Rolls and the hundred of individual entries, it's also possible to deduce how forms of inter-institutional communication functioned.
