Medieval Networks of Memory is a digital project, hosted by Stanford Text Technologies. It aims to reveal a new and dynamic picture of thirteenth-century religious and social networks and community commemoration. It will describe, map, visualize and analyse unique and culturally rich textual artefacts-the Mortuary Roll of Lucy of Hedingham, now kept at the British Library, and the Mortuary Roll of Amphelisa of Lillechurch, which belongs to St Johnâ€™s College, Cambridge.

Our research visualizes which English institutions of men and women were united in their effort to remember Prioress Lucy de Vere and Apphelisa of Lillechurch and how they sought to inscribe their respects to her. The Rolls reveal a great deal about the varieties of religious houses in the first quarter of the thirteenth century as well as the nature of scribal practices and how forms of communication functioned. Last but not least it shows us the esteem in which nuns like Lucy and Amphelisa were held.
