Our team will be producing a database that contains information for each inscription and religious house written into the roll, creating manipulable data for an interactive map, behind which will be locational, descriptive, textual, and evaluative evidence. Such data permits a much closer account of spiritual networks in this period, together with an assessment of religious houses’ resources and abilities to connect perceptibly with each other. New questions will emerge from this project’s work that we hope will allow subsequent innovative research on holy women, their communities and their scribal capability; script type and trends in the earlier thirteenth century; and the significance and methods of collective memory formation in medieval England.

## Team Overview

### Elaine Treharne

She teaches and researches Medieval Literary Cultures, Manuscript and Archival Studies, and the long History of the Book. She is the author or editor of numerous books and articles, the most recent being _The Cambridge Companion to British Medieval Manuscripts_ (CUP, 2020) and _Perspectives on Medieval Manuscripts: The Phenomenal Book_ (OUP, 2021).

She is a Trustee of the National Library of Wales in Aberystwyth.

### Mateusz Fafinski

Mateusz Fafinski is an assistant lecturer at Freie Universität Berlin and a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University. A medievalist and digital humanist, previously he was a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Lausanne and a Text Technologies Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford University. He works on the adaptations of the post-Roman worlds, the nature of historical sources in the digital sphere, early medieval Latin manuscripts, as well as the role of urban space in Early Medieval societies.

### Isabel Fryett

Isabel is a rising-senior at University of California at Riverside pursing a B.S. in Sociology. She is currently working on an Honors research project on violence in television and its influences on gender. She has previously worked with Professor Treharne on "Recollections: Reviving Personal Archives" for Stanford Text Technologies.

### Lauren Selden

Lauren Selden is a rising junior at Stanford majoring in History and minoring in Classics. She is particularly interested in the history of high and late medieval Catholicism and the practice of pilgrimage. In her free time, she enjoys going on walking pilgrimages (e.g. the Camino de Santiago), baking, reading, and learning more about the Middle Ages through fantastic projects such as Medieval Networks of Memory.

<p>
  
Within the Medieval Networks of Memory project, Lauren focuses on paleography. She combs the mortuary rolls entry by entry to identify interesting handwriting features and see if they appear in other tituli (i.e. see if they are also written by other hands). From this research, she anticipates finding intriguing trends that help explain why particular scribes wrote so distinctly. Understanding this can help all scholars of this period better understand a variety of wider subjects, including scribal education, the evolution of writing techniques, and the social and religious networks that connected monastic houses over vast distances.

### Hailee Heinrich

Hailee Heinrich is a rising junior double-majoring in Communication and Political Science. She is a member of Stanford's synchronized swimming team and is excited to be a part of this project.

<p>
  
Hailee's focus for this research interim concentrated on the applications of monumentality and remembrance to outlets beyond just mortuary rolls. She wanted to compare the similarities and nuances between mortuary rolls such as the ones the team focused on for Medieval Networks of Memory and such monuments as Maya Lin's design for the Vietnam Veterans Memorial and Daniel Libeskind's plan for the Jewish Museum in Berlin. In comparing these different structures, she was able to think more broadly on what memorialization has meant across cultures and history, while also narrowing in on how what the team chose to preserve says about us politically, culturally, and socially. Looking further, she believes it will be interesting to see what a twenty-first monument looks like and how we decide we want to carry memorialization with us into the future.

### Hannah Kim

Hannah Kim is a rising sophomore pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science with a minor in Ethics (’24). With an interest in tech research and AI policy, she is working as a research intern at Stanford CESTA and Stanford Law RegLab. 
<p>
  
For the Medieval Networks of Memory project, Hannah took a more technical approach for her research. She first attempted to utilize
computer vision to determine how much actual space on a mortuary roll each entry takes and if there were any significant patterns that the computer can pick up. For example, were there certain female houses taking more space or houses from a particular region taking less? She also worked on developing the MNM website that currently houses the team’s research, interactive maps, and project reflections.
