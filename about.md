Our team will be producing a database that contains information for each inscription and religious house written into the Roll, creating manipulable data for an interactive map, behind which will be locational, descriptive, textual, and evaluative evidence. Such data permits a much closer account of spiritual networks in this period, together with an assessment of religious houses’ resources and abilities to connect perceptibly with each other. New questions will emerge from this project’s work that we hope will allow subsequent innovative research on holy women, their communities and their scribal capability; script type and trends in the earlier thirteenth century; and the significance and methods of collective memory formation in medieval England.

Isabel is a rising-senior at University of California at Riverside pursing a B.S. in Sociology. She is currently working on an Honors research project on violence in television and its influences on gender. She has previously worked with Professor Treharne on Recollections: Reviving Personal Archives for Stanford Text Technologies.

### Lauren Claire Selden
<img src="https://hannahkim24.github.io/mnm/headshots/Selden_Profile.jpeg" height="200" width="190">
Lauren is an undergraduate at Stanford majoring in History and minoring in Classics. She is particularly interested in high and late medieval Catholicism and how shrines drew pilgrims from every class, age, and gender group from all over Europe in huge numbers during this period. In her free time, she enjoys going on walking pilgrimages (e.g. the Camino de Santiago), baking, reading, and learning more about the Middle Ages through fantastic projects such as Medieval Networks of Memory.

<p>
  
Within the Medieval Networks of Memory project, Lauren focuses on paleography. She combs the mortuary rolls entry by entry to identify interesting handwriting features and see if they appear in other tituli (i.e. see if they are also written by other hands). From this research, she anticipates finding intriguing trends that help explain why particular scribes wrote so distinctly. Understanding this can help all scholars of this period better understand a variety of wider subjects, including scribal education, the evolution of writing techniques, and the social and religious networks that connected monastic houses over vast distances.
