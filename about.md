Our team will be producing a database that contains information for each inscription and religious house written into the roll, creating manipulable data for an interactive map, behind which will be locational, descriptive, textual, and evaluative evidence. Such data permits a much closer account of spiritual networks in this period, together with an assessment of religious houses’ resources and abilities to connect perceptibly with each other. New questions will emerge from this project’s work that we hope will allow subsequent innovative research on holy women, their communities and their scribal capability; script type and trends in the earlier thirteenth century; and the significance and methods of collective memory formation in medieval England.

Mateusz Fafinski is an assistant lecturer at Freie Universität Berlin and a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University. A medievalist and digital humanist, previously he was a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Lausanne and a Text Technologies Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford University. He works on the adaptations of the post-Roman worlds, the nature of historical sources in the digital sphere, early medieval Latin manuscripts, as well as the role of urban space in Early Medieval societies.

### Isabel Fryett

Isabel is a graduate of the University of California at Riverside. She is currently working in Stanford Special Collections, while applying for graduate schools.  

<p>
  
For the Medieval Networks of Memory project, Isabel focused on the sociological aspects of women scribes and women in religion during the Middle Ages. She is interested in the way female handwriting differs from male handwriting, and if that has any correlation to the amount of education one received based on gender.

### Lauren Selden

Lauren Selden is a History undergraduate at Stanford, minoring in Classics. She is interested in the history of high and late medieval Catholicism and the practice of pilgrimage. 

<p>
  
Within the Medieval Networks of Memory project, Lauren focuses on paleography. She combs the mortuary rolls entry by entry to identify interesting handwriting features and see if they appear in other tituli (i.e. see if they are also written by other hands).

### Hailee Heinrich

Hailee Heinrich is a Stanford undergraduate, specialising in Communication and Political Science. 

<p>
  Hailee's focus for this research interim concentrated on the applications of monumentality and remembrance to outlets beyond just mortuary rolls.

Hannah Kim is Computer Science student at Stanford, with a minor in Ethics. She is interested in technology research and AI policy.
<p>
  
For the Medieval Networks of Memory project, Hannah took a more technical approach for her research, determining how much actual space on a mortuary roll each entry takes and if there were any significant patterns that the computer can detect.

Nikita Bhardwaj is a Symbolic Systems undergraduate at Stanford, and is interested in the applications of machine learning in neuroscience and the humanities.
<p>
Nikita's focus has been on the machine learning and segmentation. She has researched how using OpenCV packages can allow for automatic detection of various features on the membranes.
