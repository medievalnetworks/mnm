Our team will be producing a database that contains information for each inscription and religious house written into the Roll, creating manipulable data for an interactive map, behind which will be locational, descriptive, textual, and evaluative evidence. Such data permits a much closer account of spiritual networks in this period, together with an assessment of religious houses’ resources and abilities to connect perceptibly with each other. New questions will emerge from this project’s work that we hope will allow subsequent innovative research on holy women, their communities and their scribal capability; script type and trends in the earlier thirteenth century; and the significance and methods of collective memory formation in medieval England.
