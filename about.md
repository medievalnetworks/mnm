Our team has produced a database containing information for every institution that wrote in the Mortuary Rolls of Prioresses Amphelisa of Lillechurch and Lucy de Vere of Castle Hedingham in the 1210s to 1220s. Five hundred religious houses in England, Wales and Scotland are represented on the rolls, and here every inscription is transcribed and captured, creating manipulable data for the interactive map, behind which is locational, descriptive, textual, and evaluative evidence. This data permits a close and detailed account of spiritual networks in this period, and allows an assessment of religious houses’ resources and abilities to connect perceptibly with each other. New questions emerge from this project’s work that we hope will allow subsequent innovative research on holy women and their scribal expertise, their communities and their networks; script type and trends in the earlier thirteenth century; and the significance and methods of collective memory formation in medieval England.

Mateusz Fafinski is an assistant lecturer at Freie Universität Berlin and a postdoctoral researcher at Stanford University and the University of Tübingen. A medievalist and digital humanist, previously he was a postdoctoral scholar at the University of Lausanne and a Text Technologies Postdoctoral Fellow at Stanford University. He works on the adaptations of the post-Roman worlds, the nature of historical sources in the digital sphere, early medieval Latin manuscripts, as well as the role of urban space in Early Medieval societies.

### Isabel Fryett

Isabel is a graduate of the University of California at Riverside. She is currently working in Stanford Special Collections, while applying for graduate school.  

<p>
  
For the Medieval Networks of Memory project, Isabel focused on the sociological aspects of women scribes and women in religion during the Middle Ages. She is interested in the way female handwriting differs from male handwriting, and if that has any correlation to the amount of education one received based on gender.

Lauren Selden is a History undergraduate at Stanford, minoring in Classics. She is interested in the history of high and late medieval Catholicism and the practice of pilgrimage. 

<p>
  
Within the Medieval Networks of Memory project, Lauren focuses on palaeography. She combs the mortuary rolls entry by entry to identify interesting handwriting features to assess where they appear in tituli across the rolls.
